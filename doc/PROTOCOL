SERIAL PROTOCOL FOR FNORDLICHT-NG FIRMWARE
==========================================

Physical bus description
------------------------

The serial bus consists of up to 254 devices, each device having the uart rx
pin connected to the uart tx pin of the predecessor, the uart tx pin connected
to the tx successor.  The uart is used with a baud rate of 19200.  A device
will retransmit each received byte immediately and unaltered, the only
exception is the address byte in the sync sequence (which is incremented by one
before retransmission).  An interrupt line is connected to each device.

Bootloader startup procedure
----------------------------

On boot the device enters the bootloader section first.  It then waits to
receive 16 successive 0x88 bytes on the UART link.  If these are received
the bootloader does NOT start the application code.  In case the sequence is
not received within 100ms it calculates an 8-bit CRC checksum over the whole
application code section and compares it to the expected checksum stored as
the last byte in EEPROM memory.  If both checksums match the application
code is launched automatically.  Otherwise the bootloader will not time out
and wait for further instructions.

The aforementioned 0x88 byte sequence is emitted by the master node if the
user keeps the reflash-button pressed on startup.

Initial sync sequence
---------------------

For the purpose of (automatic) address discovery and resetting the bus, a
sync sequence consisting of 15x ESC (0x27) followed by an address byte is used.
The controller sends 15x ESC, followed by a null byte. Please note that the
length of the sync sequence (16 byte) is different from the length of a
command packet, which is 15 byte!

A device MUST be able to detect this sequence asynchronously, i.e. even if it is
in the middle of receiving a command packet. The device does not need to
withhold the execution of the received command packet until it is clear if a
sequence of ESC bytes constitutes a sync sequence.

Example:
  A device received 4 bytes, say A B C D, of a packet, then a sync sequence.
  It may (or may not) execute the packet

    A B C D ESC ESC ... ESC

  but the sync sequence must be detected, too.

Asynchronous detection of the sync sequence can be done by just counting the
number of consecutive ESC bytes, as 15 consecutive ESC bytes can only occur
in a sync sequence, never in a command packet (ESC cannot occur as a command in
the second byte of a command packet).

Flow:
* controller sends 15x ESC, followed by the address of the first device
  (usually a null)
* first device on the bus receives and retransmits 15x ESC, receives address
  byte, stores own address in ram, increments address byte and transmits new
  address to next device on the bus

Result: Each device on the bus knows it's own address (=position).


Commands
--------

Commands are sent in packets, 15 bytes in length, and are passed from device
to device unmodified.  The first byte is the destination address (0-254, 255
is broadcast), the second byte contains the command.  The meaning of the
following 13 bytes depends on the value of the second byte (command).  A
device ignores non-broadcast packets for which the address byte does not
match it's own address.  Bytes which are declared as "don't care" bytes SHOULD
be set to zero, this makes future extensions easier.

    Command: FADE_RGB - set color/fade to color (RGB) (0x02)
    --------------------------------------------------------

      Instruct the device to fade to the specified absolute color, given as a
      RGB value, with a specific speed.  Step and delay might be modified by
      application of the global offsets (see CONFIG_OFFSETS), color values
      (red, green, blue) are used unmodified.

      All values are unsigned 8 bit integers.  If step is set to 255, the target
      color is set without fading.  If delay is 0, the target color is set
      directly after receiving the command packet.

    --------------------------------------------------------

      Instruct the device to fade to the specified absolute color, given as a
      HSV value, with a specific speed.  Step, delay and hue might be modified
      by application of the global offsets, saturation and value might be scaled
      by global scales (see CONFIG_OFFSETS).

      All values are unsigned 8 bit integers, except hue, which is a 16 bit
      little endian integer.  If step is set to 255, the target color is set
      without fading.  If delay is 0, the target color is set directly after
      receiving the command packet.

    Command: SAVE_CURRENT - save current color to EEPROM (0x06)
    -----------------------------------------------------------

      Save the current color to EEPROM (RGB), together with a fade speed and a

    Command: CONFIG_OFFSETS - set global offset values (0x07)
    ---------------------------------------------------------

    Set global values which influence how fast and what colors are when using
    FADE_RGB or FADE_HSV.  All bytes are signed 8 bit integers, except hue, which
    is a little endian signed 16 bit integer.  Saturation and value are scales.
    This means, the final saturation and value will be scaled with
    saturation/255 and value/255, respectively.

        byte offset | name          |  description
        -------------------------------------------

    Command: REPLAY - replay EEPROM color sequence (0x08)
    -----------------------------------------------------

      Start replaying a color sequence stored in EEPROM, given the begin and
      end positions (end color is included).  The repeat mode specifies, what
      should be done after the end color is reached.  When repeat is set to
      zero, the fade sequence stops.  If repeat is 1, the sequence is restarted
      (from begin to end), else if repeat is 2, the sequence is replayed in
      reverse (from end to begin).  This command stops all other programs and
      EEPROM fade sequences.

      The colors stored in the EEPROM are displayed after adding the global hue
      offset.  Saturation and value are scaled with the global saturation and
      value settings (see "set global offset values" command).

      All values are unsigned 8 bit integers.

      byte offset | name   |  description
      ---------------------------------
                2 | start  | start offset, 0-59

    Command: START_PROGRAM - start program (0x09)
    ---------------------------------------------

      Start a program (a function compiled into the firmware) with given
      parameters.  This command stops all other programs (and EEPROM fade
      sequences).

      byte offset | name   |  description

             3-14 | -      | parameters passed to script function


    Command: STOP - stop color changing (0x0A)
    ------------------------------------------

      Stop all processes modifying the current color.  Optionally, also stop
      the current fading process.

      byte offset | name   |  description
      ---------------------------------
                2 | fade   | stop fading if set (1)
             3-14 | -      | don't care


    Command: MODIFY_CURRENT - modify current color (0x0B)
    -----------------------------------------------------

      Instruct the device to fade to a new target color, which is determined
      relatively to the one currently visible.  This works only if no
      program (or EEPROM fade sequence) is running.  The current color is
      faded to the target color with the given step and delay values.  The
      RGB offsets are applied before the HSV offsets.  Setting either one to
      zero will not modify the color in that color space.

      Step and delay are unsigned 8 bit integers, all other values are signed 8
      (or 16) bit integers.

    Command: PULL_INT - pull down INT line (0x0C)
    ---------------------------------------------

      Instruct the adressed device to pull down the INT line (connected to all
      devices in parallel) for a given amount of time.  This can be efficiently
      used to determine the number of devices listening to the bus (eg. by
      binary search).

             3-14 | -       | don't care


    Command: CONFIG_STARTUP - configure startup (0x0D)
    --------------------------------------------------

      Configure what a device should perform after power-up.  Mode is an
      unsigned 8 bit integer, selecting the desired startup mode.  Values which
      are not necessary for the selected mode should be treated as don't care
      values (ie set to zero).

      Four different modes can be configured:
       * PROGRAM:       Start static program, which is compiled
                        into the firmware (default)
       * STATIC_COLOR:  Fade to a specified (rgb) color,
                        using step and delay for fading
       * RANDOM:        Fade to random (HSV-)colors, using the specified saturation
                        and value, and using step and delay for fading.  Pseudo
                        random generator is initialized using seed and device
                        address.
       * REPLAY_EEPROM: Fade a color sequence stored in EEPROM, repeat if
                        configured

    Command: BOOTLOADER - start bootloader (0x80)
    ---------------------------------------------

      If a bootloader is installed, jump to the bootloader, otherwise just
      restart the device.  A magic byte sequence of 0xfc27566b (little endian)
      must follow the command byte.

      Before entering the bootloader area the application code pulls the
      interrupt line low.  The bootloader code releases it again to indicate
      successful entry.

    Command: BOOT_CONF - configure bootloader options (0x81)
    --------------------------------------------------------

      Set configuration options of the bootloader.  Currently solely the
      address where to write the data to and size of data chunks written
      each round.

      Start address is an unsigned 16-bit integer automatically incremented
      by the configured packet size upon each flash command.

      Packet size is an unsigned 8-bit integer resembling a power of 2.
      This is the packet size actually configured is 2^pktsz.  The packet
      size always has to be a multiple of the maximum page size considering
      all devices that ought to be flashed.

    Command: BOOT_DATA_INITIAL - initial data packet to bootloader (0x82)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------

      Store (initial) data packet (13 data bytes) to the beginning of the
      flash data buffer.  Further data can be provided using the
      BOOT_DATA_CONT. command.

    Command: BOOT_CRC_CHECK - compare check-sum (0x84)
    --------------------------------------------------

      Compare provided crc-8 checksum against calculated checksum over
      previously received data.  On checksum mismatch the device immediately
      pulls down the interrupt line.

      byte offset | name    |  description

    Command: BOOT_FLASH - write provided data to flash (0x85)
    ---------------------------------------------------------

      Write the data provided earlier to the flash memory of the device.

      The device pulls the interrupt line down upon reception of the command
      and releases it on successful completion of the command.  This way the
      master node is capable of detecting when the successing initial data
      packet may be provided by continuously sensing the interrupt line.

      After completion of this command the address where to flash to is
      incremented by the configured chunk data size.
